  <h1>WHAT IS GRADFLOW?</h2>
    <h2>Built for Students by Students</h2>
    <p>Gradflow makes it easy to create graduation flowcharts for students. We want to help you visualize your
      graduation path.<br>
      Don't let those prerequisite classes get the best of you! (it did for some of us) <br>
      Create your graduation flowchart and hang it up in your room! Show your parents how smart you are for finding the
      right classes!<br>
      Come back to GradFlow every semester and update your flowchart as you go using our easy to use interface! <br>
      At the end, you can print to keep it as reference!</p>

    <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
    <p>GradFlow is a team effort of CSUF 5 students for our software engineering class. </p>
